Bulk Import Files (module for Omeka S)
======================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Bulk Import Files] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to import files in
bulk with their internal metadata (for example exif, iptc and xmp for images,
audio and video, or pdf properties, etc.).

This module is backported as a [plugin] for [Omeka Classic]


Installation
------------

This module is dependant from the module [Bulk Import], that should be
installed first.

The module uses external libraries, [`getid3`] and [`php-pdftk`], so use the
release zip to install it, or use and init the source.

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

* From the zip

Download the last release [`BulkImportFiles.zip`] from the list of releases (the
master does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules`
directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `BulkImportFiles`, go to the root of the module, and run:

```
composer install --no-dev
```

The next times:

```
    composer update
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

* Install pdftk

The command line tool `pdftk` is required to extract data from pdf without raw
xmp data. It should be installed on the server and the path should be set in the
config of the module.


Usage
-----

### Configuration

The mapping of each media type (`image/jpg`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`) is
managed via the files inside the folder `data/mapping`.

So the first thing to do is to create mappings will all the needed elements.

For example, for the `JPG` format, the values are the one that are exposed via
the following xml paths (`xmp` is xml and provides all `iptc` and `exif` metadata):

```
media_type = image/jpeg
dcterms:title = /x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@xmp:Label
dcterms:description = /x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@xmp:Caption
dcterms:created = /x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@xmp:CreateDate
dcterms:modified = /x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@xmp:ModifyDate
dcterms:format = /x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@tiff:Model
dcterms:subject = /x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/dc:subject//rdf:li
```

Note that the first title is used as media type to import files, and the second
as title, if any.

If you prefer to use `exif` or `iptc`, here is the equivalent config:

```
media_type = image/jpeg
dcterms:title = iptc.IPTCApplication.Headline
dcterms:description = iptc.IPTCApplication.Caption
dcterms:created = jpg.exif.EXIF.DateTimeOriginal
dcterms:modified = jpg.exif.EXIF.DateTimeDigitized
dcterms:format = jpg.exif.FILE.MimeType
dcterms:subject = iptc.IPTCApplication.Keywords.0
dcterms:subject = iptc.IPTCApplication.Keywords.1
dcterms:subject = iptc.IPTCApplication.Keywords.2
dcterms:subject = iptc.IPTCApplication.Keywords.3
dcterms:subject = iptc.IPTCApplication.Keywords.4
```

The order of the mapping can be the opposite (`iptc.IPTCApplication.Headline = dcterms:title`),
but all the maps should be in the same order.

Note that metadata can be slighly different between standards.

### Assistant to create or update a mapping

An assistant is available to create or update a mapping via the second
sub-menu. Simply choose a directory where the files you want to import are
located, create your mapping and save it.

The assistant works only with data extractable as an array (getid3 or pdf), not
for xml data, that requires manual edition of xpaths.

### Upload

Once the mappings are ready, you can upload files via the third sub-menu
`Process import`. Just choose the folder where are files to import, then check
and add the files.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
